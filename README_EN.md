## ✨ Key Features

### 🎨 Aesthetic & Immersive UI
*   **Dynamic Background System**: Experience fluid, Apple Music-style mesh gradients that evolve based on album art colors. Supports static blur and custom user skins.
*   **Glassmorphism Design**: A polished, translucent interface that blends perfectly with your desktop environment.
*   **Responsive Layout**: A sidebar-driven navigation with a docked "Drawer-style" play queue for seamless interaction.

### 🚀 Performance Optimized
*   **Zero-Wait Startup**: Integrated theme-aware skeleton screens eliminate initial white flashes.
*   **Smart Loading**: Route-based lazy loading and asynchronous component mounting ensure the app stays snappy.
*   **Concurrency Control**: Backend image processing is throttled using Rust semaphores to prevent CPU spikes during library scans.

### 🛠️ Native Desktop Integration
*   **System Tray**: Fully integrated tray icon with window controls and quick actions.
*   **Local Management**: High-performance music file scanning, metadata extraction, and physical file organization.
*   **Advanced UX**: Custom context menus with smart boundary detection (auto-flip) and disabled browser defaults for a true native feel.
*   **Desktop Lyrics**: High-quality floating lyrics overlay for a distraction-free listening experience.
